    <h2>From Me to You</h2>
    <p>Another One</p>
    <P>Happy Birthday My Lil Bubble ❤️ <br>You mean the world to me and I wouldn't trade that for anything even a pickle jar</P>
    <br>
    <h3>The Queen of my Heart</h3>
    <p>I'll be the warrior to fight for our love;
        We'll fly together, fly higher than the doves.
        I'll be your wall and shield you from danger;
        I'll take all the pains, for to me they are no stranger.
        </p>
     

        <br>

        <h3>My lil bubble</h3>
        <p>Shall I forget the face of a bright sunshine?
            Whose beauty is comparable to an angel so divine;
            Shall I overlook your smiles that are so sweet?
            Just a glimpse of you knocks me off my feet.
            
            Shall I pass a day without seeing you?
            O r miss a chance to prove my feelings are true;
            Shall I think twice to win your heart?
            Living without you will tear me apart.</p>
            <br>
